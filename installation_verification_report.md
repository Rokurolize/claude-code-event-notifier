Total Python files in hooks directory: 12
- Core notifier files: 4 (claude_event_notifier.py, message_formatter.py, discord_sender.py, __init__.py)
- Other hook scripts: 8 (various validation and feedback scripts)

#### Configuration Validation
- Settings.json properly updated with all event hooks
- Each hook command correctly formatted with event type environment variable
- Executable permissions set on main notifier script

### 4. Remaining Tasks/Recommendations

1. **Test Event Triggering**: Run a test to verify hooks are actually triggered by Claude Code
2. **Discord Connection Test**: Verify Discord webhook/bot connection is working
3. **Log Rotation**: Consider implementing log rotation for installation logs
4. **Error Recovery**: The backup file created during installation should be documented for recovery procedures
5. **Documentation Update**: Update user documentation with the new logging capabilities

### 5. Log File Locations
- **Installation Log**: `/home/ubuntu/.claude/hooks/logs/installation_20250706_203550.log`
- **Runtime Logs**: Will be created at `/home/ubuntu/.claude/hooks/logs/discord_notifications.log` when DISCORD_DEBUG=1

The installation process completed successfully with all operations logged. The comprehensive logging additions provide excellent visibility into:
- Every file operation (read, write, copy, chmod)
- Configuration changes
- Installation progress
