# Type Safety Improvements for configure_hooks.py

## Summary

Fixed the partially unknown type issues in `configure_hooks.py` at lines where `hook.get("hooks", [])` was called by:

1. **Added `cast` import**: Added `cast` from the `typing` module to properly cast dict types to `HookConfig`.

2. **Applied type casting**: Updated the code to use `cast(HookConfig, hook)` before calling `.get("hooks")` to inform the type checker about the expected structure.

3. **Locations fixed**:
   - Line ~100: In the `remove_discord_notifier` function where hooks are filtered
   - Line ~133: In the `configure_discord_notifier` function where hooks are filtered
   - Line ~66: In the `should_keep_hook` helper function

## Changes Made

### Import Update
```python
from typing import Any, Dict, TypedDict, List, cast
```

### Type Casting Application
```python
# Before
hooks_list = hook.get("hooks", [])

# After
hook_config = cast(HookConfig, hook)
hooks_list = hook_config.get("hooks", [])
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Type Safety**: The type checker now understands the structure of hooks, reducing "partially unknown" type warnings.

2. **Consistency**: Follows the same pattern used in `discord_notifier.py` with TypedDict for structured data.

3. **Maintainability**: Makes the code easier to understand and refactor with proper type hints.

## Remaining Type Issues

Some type warnings remain due to:
- The `total=False` parameter on `HookConfig` TypedDict makes all fields optional
- Dynamic nature of JSON loading where exact types can't be guaranteed at compile time

These remaining issues don't affect functionality and are common in code that deals with external JSON data.
