# Type Fixes for configure_hooks.py

## Summary

Fixed type checking issues in `configure_hooks.py` to resolve the "partially unknown type" error at line 84 and related type errors throughout the file.

## Problem

The original code had a problematic line that chained `.get()` calls on untyped dictionaries:
```python
if "discord_notifier.py" not in hook.get("hooks", [{}])[0].get("command", "")
```

This pattern caused type checker errors because:
1. `hook` was from an untyped JSON load, making it `Any`
2. `.get()` on `Any` returns unknown types
3. Accessing `[0]` on a potentially empty list could fail
4. Chaining another `.get()` on an unknown type propagates the issue

## Solution

1. **Added TypedDict definitions** for the expected structure:
   - `HookEntry`: Defines the structure of individual hook commands
   - `HookConfig`: Defines the structure of hook configurations with optional matcher
   - Removed unused `Settings` TypedDict as it wasn't helping with the dynamic JSON

2. **Created helper functions** with proper type guards:
   - `should_keep_hook()`: Safely navigates the hook structure with explicit type checks at each level
   - `filter_hooks()`: Filters out discord notifier hooks from a list

3. **Implemented defensive programming**:
   - Check `isinstance()` at each level before accessing nested properties
   - Use explicit type annotations where helpful
   - Return early if structure doesn't match expectations

4. **Used `cast()` for type assertions** where the type checker couldn't infer types after runtime checks

## Key Changes

### Before (line 80):
```python
if "discord_notifier.py" not in hook.get("hooks", [{}])[0].get("command", "")
```

### After (in `should_keep_hook` function):
```python
# First level: ensure hook is a dict
if not isinstance(hook, dict):
    return True

# Second level: get hooks list
hooks_list = hook.get("hooks")
if not isinstance(hooks_list, list) or not hooks_list:
    return True

# Third level: get first hook entry
first_hook = hooks_list[0]
if not isinstance(first_hook, dict):
    return True

# Fourth level: get command
command = first_hook.get("command")
if not isinstance(command, str):
    return True

# Check if it's a discord notifier command
return "discord_notifier.py" not in command
```

## Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: The type checker can now verify the code without errors
2. **Runtime Safety**: Explicit checks prevent potential KeyError or IndexError exceptions
3. **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes it easier to understand the expected data format
4. **Robustness**: Handles malformed or unexpected JSON structures gracefully

## Remaining Considerations

While some type checker warnings remain due to the dynamic nature of JSON data, the code is now:
- Safe from runtime errors
- More readable with explicit type guards
- Following Python type checking best practices for handling untyped data

The use of `Any` type for JSON data is appropriate here since we're dealing with external data that needs runtime validation.
