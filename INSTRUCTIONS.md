**Branch**: fix/2025-07-16-01-35-36-bug  
**Purpose**: bugfix  

## Task Overview

### Primary Objectives
- Identify and fix reported bugs
- Add tests to prevent regression
- Update documentation if needed
- Verify fix effectiveness

## Bug Fix Target: Subagent Tracking Issue

### Issue Description
The claude-code-event-notifier has a bug in its subagent tracking system. The system needs to properly track subagent interactions and prevent prompt mixing issues.

### Known Problem Areas
1. **Subagent Detection**: The system may not properly identify when it's running as a subagent
2. **Prompt Mixing**: There may be contamination between different subagent sessions
3. **State Management**: Subagent state tracking might not be properly isolated
4. **Event Logging**: Subagent events might not be properly recorded

## Getting Started

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Navigate to this worktree directory
   - Install/update dependencies if needed
   - Run initial health checks

2. **Current Status**
   - [ ] Initial assessment completed
   - [ ] Dependencies verified
   - [ ] Tests passing
   - [ ] Documentation reviewed
   - [ ] Bug reproduction confirmed

3. **Next Steps**
   - [ ] Task 1: Investigate subagent detection mechanism
   - [ ] Task 2: Analyze prompt mixing issues
   - [ ] Task 3: Fix state management problems
   - [ ] Task 4: Implement proper event logging
   - [ ] Task 5: Add comprehensive tests

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Return to main project
cd "/home/ubuntu/workbench/projects/claude-code-event-notifier"

# Check worktree status
git worktree list

# Health check
/home/ubuntu/workbench/tools/scripts/check-project-health.sh

# Create timestamped document
/home/ubuntu/workbench/tools/scripts/create-timestamped-doc.sh "task-notes" "Content here"

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/

# Quality checks
uv run ruff check src/
uv run mypy src/
```

## Investigation Areas

### 1. Subagent Detection System
- Review `src/` directory for subagent detection logic
- Check for isSubagent functions or similar
- Examine environment variable handling

### 2. Prompt Mixing Prevention
- Look for prompt isolation mechanisms
- Check session management code
- Review transcript handling

### 3. State Management
- Investigate state storage and retrieval
- Check for proper cleanup between sessions
- Review concurrent access handling

### 4. Event Logging
- Examine logging infrastructure
- Check for proper event categorization
- Review log formatting and storage

## Test Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test subagent interactions
3. **Regression Tests**: Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete subagent workflows

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All objectives completed
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Bug reproduction tests added
- [ ] Fix effectiveness verified

## Notes

- Use conventional commit messages
- Update this file as progress is made
- Consider creating PR when ready for review
- Focus on the subagent tracking issue as primary concern
