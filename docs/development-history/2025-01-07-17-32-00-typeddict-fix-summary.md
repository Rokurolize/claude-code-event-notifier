# TypedDict Fix Summary - 20250107173200

## Issue
The type checker reported a "partially unknown type" error at line 81 in `configure_hooks.py`:
- `len(hooks_list)` where `hooks_list` had type `list[Unknown]`
- This occurred because `hooks_list` came from `hook.get("hooks", [])` where `hook` was typed as `Any`

## Solution
Added proper TypedDict definitions to provide complete type information:

1. **Added TypedDict imports and definitions**:
   ```python
   from typing import Any, TypedDict
   
   class HookEntry(TypedDict):
       """Individual hook entry with command."""
       type: str
       command: str
   
   class HookConfig(TypedDict, total=False):
       """Hook configuration with list of hooks and optional matcher."""
       hooks: list[HookEntry]
       matcher: str  # Optional, only for PreToolUse/PostToolUse
   
   class Settings(TypedDict, total=False):
       """Claude settings.json structure."""
       hooks: dict[str, list[HookConfig]]
   ```

2. **Refactored hook filtering logic**:
   - Extracted hook checking logic into a dedicated `should_keep_hook` function
   - Removed unnecessary type annotations (let type inference work)
   - Removed redundant `isinstance` checks where types are already known

3. **Benefits**:
   - No more "Unknown" type errors
   - Better code completion and type checking
   - More maintainable code with clear structure definitions
   - Follows the pattern used in `discord_notifier.py`

## Testing
- Verified the code compiles without errors
- Tested the `should_keep_hook` function with various inputs
- All functionality remains the same, only type safety improved
