# TypedDict Access Fix Summary

## Issue
The test file `test_discord_notifier.py` had TypedDict access errors on lines 87-88 where it was directly accessing the `title` field of a `DiscordEmbed` object:

```python
self.assertIn("ðŸ”§", result["title"])  # Line 88
self.assertIn("Bash", result["title"])  # Line 89
```

## Root Cause
The `DiscordEmbed` TypedDict is defined with `total=False` in `discord_notifier.py`:

```python
class DiscordEmbed(TypedDict, total=False):
    """Discord embed structure."""
    title: str
    description: str
    color: int
    timestamp: str
    footer: DiscordFooter
```

With `total=False`, all fields are optional, meaning type checkers cannot guarantee that `result["title"]` won't raise a KeyError at runtime.

## Solution
Replace direct dictionary access with the safe `.get()` method:

```python
# Type-safe access to optional TypedDict field
title = result.get("title", "")
self.assertIn("ðŸ”§", title)
self.assertIn("Bash", title)
```

This approach:
1. Uses `.get()` with a default empty string to avoid KeyError
2. Satisfies the type checker since `.get()` always returns a value
3. Maintains the same test behavior since we check `"title" in result` first

## Verification
- All unit tests pass after the fix
- No type errors in the modified lines
- The fix follows Python best practices for accessing optional dictionary keys

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Change TypedDict to `total=True`**: This would require all fields to be present, but would break flexibility for partial embeds
2. **Create separate TypedDicts**: Could have `RequiredDiscordEmbed` and `OptionalDiscordEmbed`, but adds complexity
3. **Type assertions**: Could use `cast()` or type ignores, but less safe than `.get()`

The chosen solution provides the best balance of type safety and code clarity.
